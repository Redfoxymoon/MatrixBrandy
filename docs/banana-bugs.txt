Banana Brandy update v1.20/v0.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BEAT and BEATS seperated, they do two different things.
BEAT reads current microbeat number, BEATS reads total number
of microbeats in a bar.

tokens.c/editor/c
-----------------
Can load Russell format BASIC programs (Z80/DOS/Windows BASIC).

mos.c
-----
All mos_oscli() functions combined together.
CALL OSBYTE and OSWORD on RISC OS passed directly to OS_Byte and OS_Word.


Apple Brandy update v1.20/v0.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
error.c
-------
Fixed some ERR error numbers. Added OSCLI error messages.
Fixed REPORT and default error reporter to output \r\n before message.

keyboard.c
----------
Handles zero-length function key strings correctly.

statement.s
-----------
Executing DEF correctly skips past to next line, allowing correct execution
of, multiple-entry procedures, eg:
 10 DEFPROCtimed(delay%)
 20 DEFPROCdefault:LOCAL delay%:delay%=100
 30 delay%=TIME+delay%:REPEAT UNTIL TIME>delay%:ENDPROC

Renamed emulate.c and emulate.h to mos.c and mos.h
--------------------------------------------------

mos.c
-----
OSCLI passed to OS restores text cursor to next line after any output.
Rewritten *FX to correctly parse numbers and call OSBYTE.
Added mos_osbyte() to provide low-level OSBYTE functions. Serial
handling FXs translated to OSBYTEs and renumbered to correct OSBYTE
calls.

Written cmd_parse_dec() for *FX and *KEY and any other future commands.

Added *HELP with help topics. See *HELP BASIC, *HELP MOS.

*KEY rewritten, with generalised gstrans() function.

Need to write proper command table parser to replace command_check().


Bugs identified to be fixed
===========================
GSTrans terminates at a quote when it shouldn't, eg
  *KEY 1 hello"there
should assign the string hello"there but instead assigns hello".

When sys_font[] is available, implement OSWORD 10 to read font bitmap.

Need to add *LOAD and *SAVE commands.

Integrate extensions from WinCE fork (^variable, SYS to host OS, etc.)
Add $$ to reference null-terminated strings.
Move toupper()/tolower() to in-code functions, removes need for UnixLib
on RISC OS.
Probably need host-specific modules for SYS calls.
Make *FX0,0 give appropriate error string.
RISC OS Brandy should be able to claim memory on startup instead of needing
*WimpSlot beforehand.
*cd <notfound> doesn't give any error.
MinGW: Escape causes next char to also be Escape.

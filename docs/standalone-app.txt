Building standalone applications written in BASIC with Brandy
=============================================================

Before you begin, note that the application will exit as soon as the BASIC
program exits, as if -quit were supplied on the command line for Brandy
(or *BASIC in RISC OS).

1: Enaure the build area is clean:
   make -f makefile.app clean

2: The program to be made into an app needs to be called "app" - that's due
   to the way ld makes the .o file and names the structures inside.

3: Do: ld -r b binary app -o /path/to/MatrixBrandy.build.area/src/app.o

4: Go back to your build area and do:
   make -f makefile.app

5: The resulting brandyapp binary is the app. It can be renamed and placed
   somewhere in your $PATH.

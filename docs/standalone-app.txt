Building standalone applications written in BASIC with Brandy
=============================================================

Before you begin, note that the application will exit as soon as the BASIC
program exits, as if -quit were supplied on the command line for Brandy
(or *BASIC in RISC OS).

This build process is in two stages. First, we build the .c file containing
the program to be included:

1: Ensure you have a regular build of brandy (SD or text) built.

2: Build the file (assumes you're in the top of the repo tree):
   brandy examples/bin2c /path/to/basic/file src/app.c

3: The resulting app.c file is written into the src directory. (The git tree
   is configured to ignore this file.)

Secondly, we build it:

1: Ensure the build area is clean:
   make -f makefile.app clean

2: Build the app binary:
   make -f makefile.app

3: Put the brandyapp wherever you want (usually somewhere in your $PATH),
   renaming it to what you want to call your app..

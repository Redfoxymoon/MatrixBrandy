Building standalone applications written in BASIC with Brandy
=============================================================

Before you begin, note that the application will exit as soon as the BASIC
program exits, as if -quit were supplied on the command line for Brandy
(or *BASIC in RISC OS).

This build process is in two stages. First, we build the library:

1: Enaure the build area is clean:
   make -f makefile.app clean

2: Build the static library:
   make -f makefile.app

3: Put the brandyapp.a library somewhere, such as /usr/local/lib or $HOME/lib.

Secondly, we make a .o file containing our BASIC application and link to the
library:

4: The program to be made into an app needs to be called "app" - that's due
   to the way ld makes the .o file and names the structures inside. I suggest
   copying the BASIC program to "app" leaving your original file alone.

5: Do: ld -r b binary app -o app.o

6: Link it to the library:
   gcc -o yourappname app.o /path/to/brandyapp.a -lX11 -lm -lSDL

7: The resulting yourappname binary is the app. It can be placed somewhere in
   your $PATH.

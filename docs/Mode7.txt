MODE 7 support in Brandy BASIC V/VI
===================================
As of version 1.21.2, MODE 7 is now running using a text buffer,
which recalculates the line whenever a character in it is changed. This
allows for existing lines to be modified with control codes, and existing
characters are changed to reflect the modification.

This is a change to the teletext in 1.21.0 and .1, where streams of characters
were obeyed and displayed (mostly) correctly, but placed characters would not
reflect existing codes, nor would placed codes affect existing characters.

Glyphs are using 16x20 character cells, this allows for a decent rendering
of mosaic graphics, especially separated graphics. Two fonts are used,
the main one is the high-res font based on the one from RISC OS 5, the other
being the classic SAA5050 font.

Direct screen memory access is implemented, the address can be obtained by
doing SYS "Brandy_GetVideoDriver" TO ,,,,addr%
Usually this will return &7C00 but will return &FFFF7C00 if &7C00 is in
BASIC workspace. It will always be a 32-bit address.

Some RISC OS 5 extensions are also supported:
  (source: http://beebwiki.mdfs.net/VDU_23)
VDU 23,18,1,flags,0,0,0,0,0,0 - Set Teletext display update
  bit 0 - suspend immediate updates of display bitmap (default: unset)
  bit 1 - update display after every character (default: set)
  
  Note: The defaults are the most accurate, but slowest setting. For
        performance, unset bit 1 first, then set bit 0 for the maximum
        performance at the expense of screen updates.

VDU 23,18,2,flags,0,0,0,0,0,0 - Set Teletext reveal state
  bit 0 - if set, any concealed text will be displayed. If cleared, concealed
          text is concealed.
Setting or clearing this will cause an immediate refresh of the display.

VDU 23,18,3,enable,0,0,0,0,0,0 - Set Teletext black enable
  enable = 0: Control codes &80 and &90 do nothing (default)
  enable = 1: Control code &80 selects alphanumeric black,
              control code &90 selects graphics black.
Enabling or disabling this will cause an immediate refresh of the display.

Two new OSWORD calls are available, one to read the character definition
of a teletext character, another to change a character with a new definition.
These OSWORD calls are specific to Matrix Brandy and Richard Russell's BBCSDL
with whom these extensions were developed in parallel.

OSWORD &8B (139) - Read a Teletext character definition.
Requires a block size of 43 or 44.
block%?0 = 3                     block%?0 = 4
block%?1 = 43                    block%?1 = 44
block%?2 = Character code        block%?2 = Character code
                                 block%?3 = Bank selecter, default 0
block%?3..42 - Returned data     block%?4..43 - Returned data

OSWORD &8C (140) - Write a Teletext character definition to bank 0
Requires a block size of 43
block%?0 = 43
block%?1 unused
block%?2 = Character code
block%?3..42 = Character definition, in the same layout as &8B.

OSBYTE 20 will reset the definition back to default along with the regular
non-MODE7 font.
OSBYTE 25 has been extended, if X=16 then reset teletext font only.

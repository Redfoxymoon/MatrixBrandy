MODE 7 support in Brandy BASIC V/VI
===================================

Mode 7 teletext charactes use 16x20 character cells, this allows for a
decent rendering of mosaic graphics, especially separated graphics.

Direct screen memory access is implemented, the address can be obtained by
doing SYS "Brandy_GetVideoDriver" TO ,,,,addr%
Usually this will return &7C00 but will return &FFFF7C00 if &7C00 is in
BASIC workspace. It will always be a 32-bit address.

Some RISC OS 5 extensions are also supported:
  (source: http://beebwiki.mdfs.net/VDU_23)
VDU 23,18,1,flags,0,0,0,0,0,0 - Set Teletext display update
  bit 0 - suspend immediate updates of display bitmap (default: unset)
  bit 1 - update display after every character (default: set)
  
  Note: The defaults are the most accurate, but slowest setting. For
        performance, unset bit 1 first, then set bit 0 for the maximum
        performance at the expense of screen updates.

VDU 23,18,2,flags,0,0,0,0,0,0 - Set Teletext reveal state
  bit 0 - if set, any concealed text will be displayed. If cleared, concealed
          text is concealed.
Setting or clearing this will cause an immediate refresh of the display.

VDU 23,18,3,enable,0,0,0,0,0,0 - Set Teletext black enable
  enable = 0: Control codes &80 and &90 do nothing (default)
  enable = 1: Control code &80 selects alphanumeric black,
              control code &90 selects graphics black.
Enabling or disabling this will cause an immediate refresh of the display.

Two new OSWORD calls are available, one to read the character definition
of a teletext character, another to change a character with a new definition.
These OSWORD calls are specific to Matrix Brandy and Richard Russell's BBCSDL
with whom these extensions were developed in parallel.

OSWORD &8B (139) - Read a Teletext character definition.
Requires a block size of 43 or 44.
block%?0 = 3                     block%?0 = 4
block%?1 = 43                    block%?1 = 44
block%?2 = Character code        block%?2 = Character code
                                 block%?3 = Bank selecter, default 0
block%?3..42 - Returned data     block%?4..43 - Returned data

Calling OSWORD &8B with block?0=3 and bloc?1=43 is compatible with
Richard Russel's BBCSDL as of release version  1.12a.

OSWORD &8C (140) - Write a Teletext character definition to bank 0
Requires a block size of 43
block%?0 = 43
block%?1 unused
block%?2 = Character code
block%?3..42 = Character definition, in the same layout as &8B.

OSBYTE 20 will reset the definition back to default along with the regular
non-MODE7 font.
OSBYTE 25 has been extended, if X=16 then reset teletext font only.

Certain OSBYTE calls are supported by Matrix Brandy, either by
CALL &FFF4 or result%=USR&FFF4. Use of SYS is NOT supported.

Where a return value is supported, it will be &00YYXXAA.

Supported OSBYTE calls are:
A=0:
	X=0: return the MOS version as an error.
	X=1: Return the OS version in the X register (as per the 'use' doc)

A=42:	(Note: Local to Brandy, OSBYTE 42 is not defined on BBC or RISC OS)
	X=1: Get or set refresh state (as per *REFRESH)
		Y=0: Equivalent to *REFRESH OFF
		Y=1: Equivalent to *REFRESH ON
		Y=2: Equivalent to *REFRESH ONERROR
		Y=255: Query the state, will return 0, 1 or 2 in X register.
	X=255: Analogue of Linux's "stty sane" - enables Refresh, issues a
	       VDU 6 and sets both video bank controls to 0.
A=112:	Selects which video bank the VDU drivers access. 4 available.
A=113:	Selects which video bank is drawn to the display window.
A=130:	High word of user memory.
A=131:	Bottom of user memory.
A=132:	Top of user memory
A=160:	Read VDU variable (equivalent to VDU(X%))
A=200:	Set ESCAPE and BREAK effect - only ESCAPE effect supported.
A=229:	Enable or disable ESCAPE, disabled if X non-zero.

Graphics Support
----------------

Brandy includes limited graphics support under Linux. It includes
only a subset of the facilities provided by the RISC OS VDU drivers
but it should be enough for now.
 
The graphics support is based around SDL 1.2

The graphic support includes all of the Basic graphics statements
with some restrictions and a small number of the VDU 23 commands.
The graphics 'plot action' set by VDU 18 is limited to just
setting the colour of a pixel, that is, VDU 18,0,... It is not
possible to, for example, plot points by exclusive or'ing the old
and new pixels. This is a limitation set by the library. Features
such as the extended colour fill patterns are not supported. The
standard RISC OS palettes in 2, 4, 16 and 256 colour modes are
emulated and both colour and greyscale palettes are possible.
Modes can be set using either MODE <number>, MODE <string> or
MODE <x size>, <y size>, <depth>.

All available screen modes are available under X, the window will
be sized accordingly. When running on a console frame buffer, only
those which will fit on the console screen will be available.

New display modes can be created with *NewMode, use a mode in the
range 64-126.

Teletext graphics are also supported in Mode 7, see docs/Mode7.

Four display banks are available (except in Mode 7), they are
controlled by *FX112 and FX113 as on a BBC Master or RISC OS
machine. All screen modes use the primary display, so *FX112,0
is synonymous to *FX112,1, similarly for *FX113. These are
also available as OSBYTE calls via CALL/USR &FFF4.

*REFRESH (borrowed from BB4W/BBCSDL by Richard Russell)
*REFRESH OFF: Suspends updates to the display window.
*REFRESH ON: Resume updates to the display window, updating it with
             any pending changes.
*REFRESH ONERROR: Suspends updates to the display window until an
                  error condition is encountered. This option is
                  not present in BB4W/BBCSDL.
This can also be set - and read - by OSBYTE &2A (42) with X=1.
Y=0: Equivalent to *REFRESH OFF
Y=1: Equivalent to *REFRESH ON
Y=2: Equivalent to *REFRESH ONERROR
Y=255: Returns the current setting (0-2) in Y register
       (result from USR&FFF4 in form &00YY012A).

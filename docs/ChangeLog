ChangeLog for Matrix Brandy - as forked from Sourceforge after V1.20.1
======================================================================

* V1.21.0
- Replaced system font with hand-reconstructed Acorn system font based on that
  found in RISC OS 3.1
- Initial Teletext support. Font similar to the SAA5050, teletext codes handled
  as a stream.
* V1.21.1
- Software double buffering implemented, Mode 7 Flash supported.
* V1.21.2
- Mode 7 character frame buffer implemented, line and screen recalculation
  implemented.
- Glyph size changed to 8x9 (was 8x8).
- Implemented some of RISC OS 5's Teletext extensions on VDU23,18. See
  docs/Mode7 for more details.
* V1.21.3
- Teletext fixes for edge cases
- Big performance enhancement when running in Mode 7 no-update mode
  (VDU23,18,1,0|)
- Nested FOR..NEXT fix - thanks Coeus @ stardot.org.uk forums for the patch
- *. is remapped to *ls - so running *. now lists the contents of your current
  directory.
- Mode 7 screen memory access, mapped to &FFFF7C00-&FFFF7FFF. Althought Tube
  BASIC didn't directly allow host screen access, this is where it would have
  been mapped for file system access and OSWORD 6. In Matrix Brandy, just access
  the memory directly.  Note that scrolling does NOT move the start address of
  the screen, the top left character cell will ALWAYS be at &FFFF7C00.
- Fix for PLOTting out of range causing a segfault.
- Fix for DRAWing out of bounds on non-scaled modes with < 800x600 resolution.
* V1.21.4
- Slight rename of application to Matrix Brandy, to distinguish between this
  and the "base" version from Sourceforge, and other forks.
- MOUSE commands no longer error as unsupported. Most now no-op, but
  MOUSE X, Y, B[, C] returns mouse position and button state. If specified,
  C contains a centisecond counter.
  (In this implementation, it equals the value of TIME).
- INKEY with negative argument partially supported. (-129 to -255 not supported)
* V1.21.5
- Merged J.G.Harston's "Banana Brandy" fork, and cleaned up some breakages
  caused by this.
- Refactor code to use new mos.c function names, remove aliases from mos.h
- PLOT codes for drawing dotted lines implemented, along with skipping start
  and end points as required.
- Fix behaviour of OPENUP for file not found - thanks Phlamethrower @ *. for
  the pointer.
* V1.21.6
- Implemented some network connectivity. Connect using OPENUP"ip4:host:port".
  Currently only EOF#, BGET# and BPUT# work (both bytes and strings for BPUT)
- New demo: examples/Mode7/telstar - a client for Telstar!

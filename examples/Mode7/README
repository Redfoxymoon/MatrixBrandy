Here are some examples for Mode 7.

engtest.dat can be displayed in Brandy in Mode 7 using *cat engtest.dat

(Yes, counter-intuitive, but remember that * commands are passed to the
underlying Linux system, so *cat does what *type would do on a BBC / RiscOS
system.)

telstar is a Brandy BASIC Telstar client, demonstrating both the Mode 7
capability and the network connectivity feature added in V1.21.6
